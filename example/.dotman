# This is the dotman configuration file

# You can define folder aliases with the equal(=) operator, like so:
root=/

# You can utilize environment variables:
home=$HOME


# You can define the default folder with the dot(.) symbol.
# It is the fallback in case there are no alias matches with the above:
.=$HOME
